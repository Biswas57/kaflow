## Project Overview
The Kaflow Message Broker is an extremely simplified version of the event streaming infrastructure [**Apache Kafka**](https://kafka.apache.org/). A quick read of Kafka's design and purpose is recommended to understand the basis and workings of this project, a brief video to understand what Kafka is can be found [**here**](https://youtu.be/vHbvbwSEYGo). 

Kaflow is an Event-Driven Message Broker made for smaller Event-Driven Architectures (EDA). The fundamental premise on which EDA rests is the ability of producer and consumer entities in the system to share data asynchronously via a stream-like channel, which is why this project is named 'Kaflow'. Therefore, stream processing allows data to move through a data pipeline to be analysed and processed asynchronously and efficiently in real-time. This is opposed to batch processing where data is collected and stored to be operated upon later. 

This library enhances the traditional in-memory stream EDA, such as RabbitMQ, which often relies on a single message queue shared by multiple consumers causing bottlenecks and delays, by incorporating elements of batch processing in certain scenarios such as replayability in event logs and delayed and parallel event consumption. By adopting a log-based approach, we overcome the limitations of message playback and memory storage seen in single message queue brokers. This improvement enhances data storage, replayability, and adds greater functionality to message processing, enabling more efficient and flexible handling of events across multiple channels.

### Breakdown of Engineering Requirements
A complete visual overview of the entire system exist, showcasing the system in the [**final UML Diagram**](Blogging&Design/UML_final_design.pdf) and a more extensive overview of the required capabilities, constrains and functionality of the system, that had been created in the beginnging of this project (so it is a little outdated) can be found in the [**Engineering Requirements**](Engineering_Requirements.md). Furthermore, a full recount of the engineering process can be found in the following links:

## Initialisation and Developer Use
To help other developers interact with the Kaflow library without having to implement the library entirely, the main entry point is the `ControllerCLI` class. This class provides a command-line interface to create, modify, and interact with the Kaflow system.

### Path to Main Function:
```
app/src/main/java/tributary/cli/ControllerCLI.java
```

### Steps to Run the ControllerCLI:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Tributary-Cluster.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

    ```bash
    cd Tributary-Cluster
    ```

3. **Build the Project**: The project uses Gradle for build automation. Build the project using:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```

    If you're on Windows, use:

    ```cmd
    gradlew.bat build
    ```

4. **Run the CLI**: After building, you can run the `ControllerCLI` using the Java command

    ```bash
    java -cp build/classes/java/main tributary.cli.ControllerCLI
    ```

    Ensure the classpath points to the directory where your compiled classes are located.

5. **Interact with the CLI**: Once the `ControllerCLI` is running, you can enter commands described in the follwoing section to interact with the Kaflow.


### CLI Commands and Usability Testing
To run usability tests on this library I needed to develop a way to interact with tributaries, producers, and consumers via a command line interface. To do so, I coded a wrapper class called `ControllerCLI` that allows the user to input commands that create, modify, and interact with a Kaflow system.
